Jump Game II:

Valid but naive solution (almost certainly a better way):

We start from the back of the array, and iterate to the front, storing the mimimum number of jumps to reach the end as we go.  If a position is not within direct reach of the end, we look at all positions that are in range, and take the minimum jumps to the end out of those.
